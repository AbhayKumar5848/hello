# Hi, I'm Abhay Kumar 👋


<strong>Frontend Developer • React Enthusiast • UI Engineer</strong>

I'm a passionate Computer Science Engineering student with a deep interest in frontend development, React.js, and crafting seamless user experiences. I love turning creative ideas into responsive, interactive, and scalable web applications that perform beautifully across all devices.

With hands-on experience in building and deploying dynamic projects using React.js, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS, I focus on clean code, optimized performance, and visually engaging interfaces. My goal is to bridge the gap between design and functionality — creating digital experiences that users love.

I’m constantly exploring modern frontend technologies, mastering state management, and integrating APIs to build fast, user-centric applications. I believe in learning by doing — from developing full-fledged clones to optimizing real-world production websites.

With strong skills in JavaScript (ES6+), C++, and web architecture, I’m dedicated to continuous growth and pushing the limits of what’s possible in web development.
